# Multirotor Design, Control & Path Planning using Cascaded PID in Simulink
This project is the term project for "Aerial Robotics" course of Mechanical Engineering Department at Sharif University of Technology.
The project includes two separate phases. In the first one we have designed a quad-rotor with 6 degrees of freedom. 
We chose different component including propellers, motors, batteries, and navigational sensors. The multirotor contains two tilt rotors and two stationary rotors.
Therefore, our aircraft is capable of flying in arbitrary direction while preserving its orientation. 
We have also designed a robust cascaded PID controller for our robot so it can follow a trajectory.
